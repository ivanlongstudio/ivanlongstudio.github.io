<h1>Annihilation awaits</h1>
<p>Throwing caution to the wind, the mighty Zerker blasts their way through the lines of men. Smashing through the cobblestone wall.</p>
<p>"RIP AND TEAR! BLOOD FOR THE ALL FATHER!"</p>
<p>"GUARDS!" The guild receptionest yells again, this time in a decidedly more pacnicked tone.</p>
<p>Mages are brought in to subdue the mighty being before them until a warrior appears to block your path.</p>

<h1>"Foul demon, berserker or not, not even your kind would harm innocents like this! I shall take your head!"</h1>
<a href="dexteritycheckb.html">Dodge nimbly around his blade.</a>
<p><a href="strengthcheckb.html">Smash through his offense with a powerful strike of your own!</a></p>
<p><a href="intelligencecheckb.html"> Cast a spell and surprise him!</a></p>
