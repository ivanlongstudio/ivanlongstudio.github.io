<h1>Ever heard of the Goblin Slayer? Yeah you should've brought him.</h1>
<p>Goblins always catch unsuspecting newbie parties in the caves. Intricate cave networks, low light levels, limited space. All a recipe for disaster even for an experienced group.</p>
<p>On this eve it happens exactly in the way you'd expect. Your party is slowly dismantled starting from getting lost in the low ceiling caverns, poison traps catching you guys off guard, and eventually being surrounded from multiple tunnels.</p>
<p>No god can save you down here, one can only wait for death to free them from the goblin embrace.</p>
