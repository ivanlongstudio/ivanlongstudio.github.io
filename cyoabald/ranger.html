<h1>Back in Nam</h1>
<p>Welcome back to Earth! Except its 1965 and you are a soldier shipped off to fight.</p>
<p>Without a clue as what to do and with no formal training since you seemingly spawned in out of thin air, you are sent to the front lines and are shot by men hidden in the trees.</p>
<p>The best part is, no dexterity check is going to save you from bullets.</p>
<h1>:WAR:</h1>
<p>You will be  <a href="https://youtu.be/fLZlxVzoG9Y?si=IfzmoDF901UK9ndA">remembered</a> , but not for your adventures in Faerun.</p>
